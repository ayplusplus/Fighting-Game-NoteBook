This project is made with the Flask framework. 
As for the domain I am currently using Pythonanywhere.com. Allowing a limited but consistent domain for user's to test the project and still enjoy it for themselves!
The games that are used in the project is Mortal Kombat 1, Street Fighter 6, and lastly 2XKO!
This project can allow fighting game players to take their mobile notebook to tournaments and have their notes easily accessible.
Hope you Enjoy!
